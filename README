Exchange Web Services for PHP
=========

This is a basic library that abstracts a few of common operations using the Exchange Web Services API present on Exchange Server 2007. It is based in large part on this article:

Right now only basic operations are supported (getting a list of all email from a user's inbox, and sending a message), but as time goes on hopefully more funtionality will be added.

My code from this project is licensed under the MIT License (see the included LICENSE file for more information). However, for convenience, I have included the SOAP definition files from an Exchange Server -- these files are most definitely not open source, and I may at some point receive a takedown request for them. However, the are available on your Exchange Server, so anyone who is using this library would (presumably) have a license to use these files as well.
