Exchange Web Services for PHP
=========

This is a basic library that abstracts a few of common operations using the Exchange Web Services API present on Exchange Server 2007. It is based in large part on this article:

http://www.howtoforge.com/talking-soap-with-exchange

Right now only basic operations are supported (getting a list of all email from a user's inbox, and sending a message), but as time goes on hopefully more funtionality will be added.

==INSTALLATION==

Installation is a bit more complicated than I'd like, but most of that is due to the way the API is set up.

The first thing you must do is download the SOAP files from your Exchange server. Those files are located here:

http://exchange.server.local/EWS/Services.wsdl
http://exchange.server.local/EWS/messages.xsd
http://exchange.server.local/EWS/types.xsd

Download those three files, and place them in the same directory as the "Exchangelcient.php" file.

Finally, open up the Services.wsdl file in a TEXT EDITOR (do not use a Word Processor like MS Word), and at the very bottom of the file, before the final </wsdl:definitions> tag, add the following:

<wsdl:service name="ExchangeServices">
		<wsdl:port name="ExchangeServicePort" binding="tns:ExchangeServiceBinding">
			<soap:address location="http://exchange.server.local/EWS/Exchange.asmx"/>
		</wsdl:port>
	</wsdl:service>

Be sure to replace the exchange.server.local with your actual exchange server address.

That's it! You should now be ready to use the library. Just include it in your PHP script, and you're off. 

==EXAMPLE CODE==

The following code initializes the library and sends off a quick test messsage:

$exchangeclient = new Exchangeclient();
$exchangeclient->init("mailbox_username", "mailbox_password");
$exchangeclient->send_message("you@otherdomain.com", "Subject", "A test message");

My code from this project is licensed under the MIT License (see the included LICENSE file for more information). However, for convenience, I have included the SOAP definition files from an Exchange Server -- these files are most definitely not open source, and I may at some point receive a takedown request for them. However, the are available on your Exchange Server, so anyone who is using this library would (presumably) have a license to use these files as well.
